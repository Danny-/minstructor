* create more tests
* man page
* mcollector can search by itself for key-value pairs, thus giving keywords on the command line can be optional
* mcollector should take data files as optional parameters without using a command line flag. Thus you should use the mcollector with bash expansion. I removed the ability to give prefixes for the data directory, as this could result in a double read of the data files depending on the UNIX find implementation.
* mcollector should 'somehow' mention if a file does not contain any keyword at all, as this might be caused by an unknown error
* add how to install gems and how to setup the PATH variable appropriately in documentation

## Test cases
./minstructor -c "./myapp [1,2] -c [3,4]"
./minstructor -c "./myapp ~/mayarg0 ~/myarg2" -n 10 -o pth/to/output/prefix
  - check the generation of more than 30k commands
